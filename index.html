Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The purpose of this code and app is to create a canvas that will perform various functions. When clicked/prompted a button should draw a rectangle, another button should write the author's name, another button should load an image, and lastly a button should clear everything. 
 
Known Issues:
I had to move the script with varibles and functions at the very end to ensure the code would execute. The picture will appear on the page as well as when the button is clicked I could not comment it out. Additionally, I was trying to add another image but was not able to do so.

<!--The functions that will draw the various elements on the canvas-->

console.log("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates message in javaScript console (found in developers tools) with time stamp.*/
//Getting rid of the alert 


//Had to put all the varibles and functions at the end so they would work and disaply the elements 
	var c = document.getElementById("a"); //This variable connects the functions to the canvas 
	var ctx = c.getContext("2d"); //This variable allows all the elements to be shown 


	function drawRectangle(){
		ctx.fillStyle = "black";
			ctx.fillRect(50, 25, 150, 100);
	}
//This function will draw a black rectangle in the top left corner of the canvas 
//The first two numbers represent the position and the last two represent the size 

	function drawName(){
		ctx.font = "30px Georgia";
			ctx.fillText("Jeeya", 200, 200);
	}
//This function outputs my name in the middle of the canvas 
//The numbers present the position 
	
	function drawImage(){
		var img = document.getElementById("hamster");
